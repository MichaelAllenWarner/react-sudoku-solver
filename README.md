# Mike’s MERN Sudoku Solver

This is the React version of my Sudoku Solver. It’s [hosted on Heroku](https://mikes-react-sudoku-solver.herokuapp.com) (Heroku puts it in sleep mode after a period of inactivity, so it might take a few seconds to load). The [original version](https://github.com/MichaelAllenWarner/sudoku-solver) used vanilla JS for the UI/UX; the readme over there summarizes how the solver works.

As an exercise in [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) and the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), I’ve added a “Random Puzzle” feature that queries a MongoDB collection, grabs one of [these](http://norvig.com/top95.txt) difficult puzzles at random, and displays it on the board without reloading the page. The ES5 bundle I [selectively serve to legacy browsers](https://michaelallenwarner.github.io/webdev/2019/05/22/how-to-serve-es6+-to-modern-browsers-and-es5-to-legacy-browsers.html) includes a [polyfill for Fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) that makes this feature compatible with IE 10 and 11. (Since these old browsers cache AJAX requests by default, I also configured Express to instruct them not to do so; otherwise clicking the “Random Puzzle” button a second time pulls up the cached board instead of fetching a new random one.)

While building this app, I encountered some strange React behavior (perhaps a bug?) that made it difficult to manually restrict what the user can enter into the input boxes in the cells of the board. I found a fix, and I’ve blogged about it [here](https://michaelallenwarner.github.io/webdev/2019/05/24/restricting-user-input-on-a-number-type-input-box-in-react.html).
